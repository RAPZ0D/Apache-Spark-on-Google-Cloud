# Apache-Spark-on-Google-Cloud

## Introduction
Welcome to the Apache Spark on Google Cloud repository! My name is Joel Mendonsa, and I am a data science enthusiast with a background in data integration. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which inspired me to explore Apache Spark for big data processing.
