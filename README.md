# Apache-Spark-on-Google-Cloud

## Introduction
Welcome to the Apache Spark on Google Cloud repository! My name is Joel Mendonsa, and I am a data science enthusiast with a background in data integration. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which inspired me to explore Apache Spark for big data processing.

## Overview
In this repository, I showcase various projects demonstrating the usage of Apache Spark on Google Cloud Platform using PySpark. Apache Spark is a powerful distributed computing framework widely used for processing large-scale data sets, and Google Cloud Platform provides an ideal environment for deploying and running Spark applications.
