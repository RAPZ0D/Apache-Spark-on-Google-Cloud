# Apache-Spark-on-Google-Cloud

## Introduction
Welcome to the Apache Spark on Google Cloud repository! My name is Joel Mendonsa, and I am a data science enthusiast with a background in data integration. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which inspired me to explore Apache Spark for big data processing.

## Overview
In this repository, I showcase various projects demonstrating the usage of Apache Spark on Google Cloud Platform using PySpark. Apache Spark is a powerful distributed computing framework widely used for processing large-scale data sets, and Google Cloud Platform provides an ideal environment for deploying and running Spark applications.

### Key Points:
- **Data Science Background**: As a student of data science and data integration, I understand the importance of efficient data processing and analysis.
- **Inspiration from GCP**: My experience with Google Cloud Platform during lectures motivated me to explore Apache Spark for big data analytics.
- **Ease of Use**: Leveraging Google Cloud Platform for Spark projects eliminates the need for local installation and setup, making it convenient and accessible.
- **Cloud-Based Approach**: By utilizing Google Cloud Platform services such as Google Dataproc clusters, I demonstrate how to leverage the power of Apache Spark in a cloud environment without the hassle of managing infrastructure.
